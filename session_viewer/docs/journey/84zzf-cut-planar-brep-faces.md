# 16.4.20 · Cut planar BRep faces

**Chapter 16 · Geometry editing and measurement · Section 16.4 · Solid volume, extension and Explode** · [Contents](contents.md)

**Typing: 23–46 minutes.** [Estimate](typing-load.md).

Find crossed planar faces, split them through the kernel and collect section edges. Report unsupported curved sections explicitly.

## Type

### 1. `src/trim_parts.rs`

Add this part-building behavior to the existing owner.

```rust
            Some((_, _, faces)) => faces.push(face),
            None => groups.push((key, region, vec![face])),
        }
    }

    groups.into_iter().map(|(_, _, faces)| faces).collect()
}
```

After that block, type:

```rust
/// Split every face `plane` passes through; returns the new edges on the plane.
fn cut_by_plane(brep: &mut BRep, plane: &Plane) -> Result<Vec<Vec<Point>>, String> {
    let normal = plane.z_axis();
    let origin = plane.origin();
    let side = |p: &Point| (p - &origin).dot(&normal);
    let size = brep
        .m_vertices
        .iter()
        .map(|v| v.point[0].abs().max(v.point[1].abs()).max(v.point[2].abs()))
        .fold(1.0, f64::max);
    let near = TOLERANCE * size;

                low = low.min(d);
                high = high.max(d);
            }
        }

        // all on one side: nothing to cut
        if low > -near || high < near {
            continue;
        }

        // curved sections are left out: the kernel's surface-plane tracer costs 15 KB of wasm
        let own = planar(surface).ok_or(

        )?;
        let Some(line) = intersection::plane_plane(&own, plane) else {
            continue;

        )?;
        crossed |= next.face_count() > before;
        *brep = next;
    }

    if !crossed {
        return Err("not crossed".into());
    }

    // edges lying in the plane are the cut
    let mut section = Vec::new();

    for edge in &brep.m_edges {
        let Some(curve) = brep
            .m_curves_3d
            .get(edge.curve_3d_index.max(0) as usize)
            .filter(|_| edge.curve_3d_index >= 0)
        else {
            continue;
        };
        let points = samples(curve, 8);

        if points.iter().all(|p| side(p).abs() <= near * 10.0) {

## Run and check

Run this from `session_viewer` to select the fixed dependency versions and install supplied binary assets. It updates Cargo.lock and preserves the previous lock. It does not write implementation code:

```sh
npm --prefix ../session_tests run course -- dependencies 16.4.20
```

In your project:

```sh
cd workspace/journey
REGEN_PROTO=0 cargo build --lib --locked --target wasm32-unknown-unknown -j1
REGEN_PROTO=0 CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=1 trunk serve --port 8780
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8780/`. Keep an existing Trunk server running; saving rebuilds it.



### Recorded visual result

**Previous native render — current verification pending.**

*This recorded image predates a source or checker change. Rebuild this checkpoint before using it as current evidence; browser controls require separate acceptance.*

This reference image is shared with [16.4.15 · Describe removable CAD parts](84zza-describe-removable-cad-parts.md). It does not demonstrate a new feature by itself.

original CAD geometry → removable parts → retained source geometry.



Why scale the plane tolerance with the geometry?

The local coordinate magnitude controls how close a point must be to the plane.

Study estimate, including typing and experiments: 0.8–1 hours.

<details>
<summary>Optional experiment</summary>

Trace a missing plane, a crossed flat face and a crossed curved face through the error paths.

<summary>Check and save your work</summary>

Restore experimental edits, then run from `session_viewer`:

```sh
npm --prefix ../session_tests run course -- check 16.4.20
npm --prefix ../session_tests run course -- save 16.4.20
```
