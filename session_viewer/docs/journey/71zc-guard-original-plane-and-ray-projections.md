# 14.1.40 · Guard original plane and ray projections

**Chapter 14 · Coordinates and geometry tools · Section 14.1 · Sheet queries and construction planes** · [Contents](contents.md)

**Typing: 29–58 minutes.** [Estimate](typing-load.md).

Complete the original plane queries for view choice, nearest projection, facing and ray intersection. Reuse the same origin, axes and normal. Reject a grazing ray before dividing by its small plane-normal component.

## Run and check

Run this from `session_viewer` to select the fixed dependency versions and install supplied binary assets. It updates Cargo.lock and preserves the previous lock. It does not write implementation code:

```sh
npm --prefix ../session_tests run course -- dependencies 14.1.40
```

In your project:

```sh
cd workspace/journey
REGEN_PROTO=0 cargo build --lib --locked --target wasm32-unknown-unknown -j1
REGEN_PROTO=0 CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=1 trunk serve --port 8780
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8780/`. Keep an existing Trunk server running; saving rebuilds it.

Plane and ray projection guards compile before drawing input uses them.

Why reject grazing rays before intersection?

A nearly parallel ray makes the intersection unstable. Preserve the original guard instead of returning a distant misleading drawing point.

Study estimate, including typing and experiments: 0.5–1 hours.

<summary>Optional experiment</summary>

Compare a perpendicular ray, a grazing ray and a ray facing away from the plane.

Restore experimental edits, then run from `session_viewer`:

These original frame and coordinate helpers are preparatory until the existing input bridge connects them. The earlier drawing stays unchanged.
