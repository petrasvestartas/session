# 16.4.30 · Sample original CAD families for selection

**Chapter 16 · Geometry editing and measurement · Section 16.4 · Solid volume, extension and Explode** · [Contents](contents.md)

**Typing: 24–48 minutes.** [Estimate](typing-load.md).

Reuse original curve corners, curved domains, mesh vertices and BRep references as bounded selection samples. Distinguish no samples from a failed inside test.

## Type

Continue from [Test window membership and segment crossings](84znb-test-window-membership-and-segment-crossings.md). [Save or recover your work](recovery.md).

### 1. `src/selection_region.rs`

Extend the existing original selection owner.

```rust
        if !(row >= 0.0 && (row as usize) < self.rows.len()) {
            return false;
        }

        self.rows[row as usize].partition_point(|x| *x < at.0) % 2 == 1
    }
}
```

After that block, type:

```rust

    samples: impl Iterator<Item = [f64; 3]>,

    for sample in samples {
        if !inside(sample) {
            return Some(false);
        }

        any = true;
    }

    any.then_some(true)
}

    let even = (0..if straight { 0 } else { steps + 1 })
        .map(move |i| curve.point_at(t0 + (t1 - t0) * i as f64 / steps as f64));
    corners.chain(even).map(|p| xyz(&p))
}

    (0..side * side)

## Run and check

Run this from `session_viewer` to select the fixed dependency versions and install supplied binary assets. It updates Cargo.lock and preserves the previous lock. It does not write implementation code:

```sh
npm --prefix ../session_tests run course -- dependencies 16.4.30
```

In your project:

```sh
cd workspace/journey
REGEN_PROTO=0 cargo build --lib --locked --target wasm32-unknown-unknown -j1
REGEN_PROTO=0 CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=1 trunk serve --port 8780
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8780/`. Keep an existing Trunk server running; saving rebuilds it.



### Recorded visual result

*This recorded image predates a source or checker change. Rebuild this checkpoint before using it as current evidence; browser controls require separate acceptance.*

This reference image is shared with [16.4.15 · Describe removable CAD parts](84zza-describe-removable-cad-parts.md). It does not demonstrate a new feature by itself.

Why preserve None for an empty sample iterator?

An empty geometry cannot establish complete enclosure; its bounds may supply the fallback.

Study estimate, including typing and experiments: 0.8–1 hours.

<details>
<summary>Optional experiment</summary>

Compare a degree-one curve with a curved domain. Trace the first outside sample through the enclosure helper.

<summary>Check and save your work</summary>

Restore experimental edits, then run from `session_viewer`:

```sh
npm --prefix ../session_tests run course -- check 16.4.30
npm --prefix ../session_tests run course -- save 16.4.30
```
