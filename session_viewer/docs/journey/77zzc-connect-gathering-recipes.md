# 15.1.37 · Connect gathering recipes

**Chapter 15 · Transforms and surface construction · Section 15.1 · Transforms, extrusions and revolutions** · [Contents](contents.md)

**Typing: 23–45 minutes.** [Estimate](typing-load.md).

Connect typed input to a recipe, its questions and kernel builder. Reuse the existing option matcher and expose typed point, number and axis helpers.

### 1. `src/gather_input.rs`

Insert the next gathering behavior after its existing declarations.

<summary>Locate the existing block</summary>

```rust
    pub choice: &'static str,     // the chosen option, empty when none
    pub normal: Vector,           // the construction plane the camera faces
}
```

</details>

After that block, type:

```rust
impl Input {
    /// The Distance answer as a vector along `axis`.
    pub fn along(&self, index: usize, axis: &Vector) -> Option<Vector> {
        match self.answers.get(index)? {
            Answer::Number(value) => Some(axis * *value),
            Answer::Vector(vector) => Some(vector.clone()),
            Answer::Point(_) => None,
        }
    }

    /// The Point answer at `index`.
    pub fn point(&self, index: usize) -> Option<Point> {
        match self.answers.get(index)? {
            Answer::Point(p) => Some(p.clone()),
            _ => None,
        }
    }

    /// The Number answer at `index`.
    pub fn number(&self, index: usize) -> Option<f64> {
        match self.answers.get(index)? {
            Answer::Number(value) => Some(*value),
            _ => None,
        }
    }
}

/// What a build made and what to say about it.
pub struct Made {
    pub geometries: Vec<Geometry>, // added as one undo step
    pub message: String,           // e.g. `Lofted 3 curves into a NURBS surface`
}

/// A command that gathers curves and answers, then builds.
pub struct Recipe {
    pub name: &'static str,                             // shown name
    pub chips: &'static [(&'static str, &'static str)], // buttons: options, then Finish and Cancel
    pub steps: &'static [Step],                         // what it asks, in order
    pub axis: fn(&Input) -> (Point, Vector), // where a Distance step slides, unit direction
    pub build: fn(&Input) -> Result<Made, String>, // the objects from the answers
}

impl std::fmt::Debug for Recipe {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut std::fmt::Formatter) -> std::fmt::Result {
        f.write_str(self.name)
    }
}

impl Recipe {
    /// The option labels, e.g. Open and Closed.
    pub fn choices(&self) -> impl Iterator<Item = &'static str> {
        options::choices(self.chips)
    }

    /// The option `words` start with and how many words spell it, ignoring case and spaces.
    pub fn option_in(&self, words: &[&str]) -> Option<(usize, usize)> {
        options::find(self.chips, words)
    }

    /// The steps that are not curve picks.
    pub fn others(&self) -> impl Iterator<Item = &'static Step> {
        self.steps.iter().filter(|step| !step.curves())
    }
}

## Run and check

Run this from `session_viewer` to select the fixed dependency versions and install supplied binary assets. It updates Cargo.lock and preserves the previous lock. It does not write implementation code:

```sh
npm --prefix ../session_tests run course -- dependencies 15.1.37
```

In your project:

```sh
cd workspace/journey
REGEN_PROTO=0 cargo build --lib --locked --target wasm32-unknown-unknown -j1
REGEN_PROTO=0 CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=1 trunk serve --port 8780
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8780/`. Keep an existing Trunk server running; saving rebuilds it.

Why reuse the option matcher?

Solid and gathering commands use the same labels and case-insensitive multiword matching rules.

Study estimate, including typing and experiments: 0.8–1 hours.

<summary>Optional experiment</summary>

Trace a numeric distance along an axis and compare it with an explicit vector.

<summary>Check and save your work</summary>

Restore experimental edits, then run from `session_viewer`:

```sh
npm --prefix ../session_tests run course -- check 15.1.37
npm --prefix ../session_tests run course -- save 15.1.37
```

Source comparison leaves your project untouched. [Save and recovery instructions](recovery.md).
